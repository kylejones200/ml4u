# Machine Learning for Power & Utilities

**A Practical Guide to Applying AI and ML in the Electric Utility Industry**

---

## The Challenge

Electric utilities face unprecedented pressures: aging infrastructure, rising demand, and the urgent need to decarbonize. Traditional operational methods—reactive maintenance, static forecasts, manual inspections—are no longer sufficient. The grid is becoming more complex, more distributed, and more variable. Utilities need intelligent systems that can predict, adapt, and optimize in real time.

## The Solution

This book bridges the gap between machine learning theory and utility operations. It provides practical, production-ready approaches to applying ML across the entire utility lifecycle—from load forecasting and predictive maintenance to outage prediction, renewable integration, and customer analytics.

Unlike generic ML books, this guide is grounded in real utility scenarios. Every technique is explained in the context of actual operational challenges: balancing supply and demand, preventing equipment failures, managing storm response, integrating distributed energy resources, and ensuring grid reliability.

## Why This Book Matters

**Few books address ML specifically for utilities.** Most ML resources are generic, leaving practitioners to figure out how to apply techniques to grid operations, asset management, and regulatory compliance.

**This book provides:**
- **Real utility scenarios** with business context and operational impact
- **Production-ready code** that demonstrates complete workflows
- **Regulatory awareness** addressing compliance, ethics, and governance
- **Practical guidance** on when to use which techniques and how to avoid common pitfalls

**The result:** You'll learn not just how to build ML models, but how to deploy them in a regulated industry where reliability, safety, and transparency are non-negotiable.
