Write concise pythonic code. No long if/else blocks. Use clear abstractions and dispatch patterns.


Avoid if/else chains. Use dictionaries, first-class functions, polymorphism, pattern matching, or small helper functions instead of conditional branches. Keep code pythonic and concise.

No if/else chains. Replace conditional logic with dispatch tables, object methods, or pattern matching.

No nested conditionals. Refactor each decision into a separate function or strategy.


Replaced if/else with idiomatic patterns — use ternary operators, early returns, and conditional expressions
PEP 8 compliance — fixed line length, spacing, and naming
Production-ready — removed unnecessary comments and self describing code

For all Matplotlib code:
Use a minimalist Tufte-style design.
No gridlines.
Use a serif font.
Remove top and right spines.
Use black and white markers.
Show mean, 20%, and 80% y-axis reference lines.
Always include plt.savefig('<descriptive-name>.png') before plt.show().
No Seaborn styling.
