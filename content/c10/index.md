### The Business Problem: Automating Inspections and Reducing Field Costs

Utilities manage enormous physical infrastructure spread across thousands of square miles, including poles, wires, substations, transformers, and solar farms. Inspecting and maintaining this infrastructure has traditionally relied on field crews conducting manual patrols or scheduled visits. These inspections are expensive, labor-intensive, and slow, making it difficult to identify problems before they escalate into failures or safety hazards.

Aging infrastructure, increasing regulatory scrutiny, and the growing scale of distributed assets—such as rooftop solar and grid-scale renewables—make manual inspection unsustainable. Vegetation encroachment near lines can lead to faults or fires. Damaged insulators, cracked panels, or corroded connectors can go unnoticed until they fail. Utilities need scalable ways to monitor assets continuously and detect issues early.

### The Analytics Solution: Using Computer Vision for Asset Monitoring

Computer vision automates inspection by using machine learning models to analyze images or video captured from drones, fixed cameras, or mobile devices. Models trained on labeled examples can detect defects such as broken insulators, damaged conductors, panel cracks, or vegetation encroachment.

These systems allow utilities to monitor infrastructure without dispatching crews for every inspection cycle. High-resolution imagery can be collected via drones after storms, during routine patrols, or even continuously from fixed cameras in substations or along rights-of-way. Automated analysis identifies anomalies and prioritizes those requiring human review or immediate action.

Integration with enterprise systems makes the process even more powerful. Detected defects can trigger work orders in asset management platforms or feed into risk scoring models for predictive maintenance. This reduces the time from detection to resolution and improves overall asset reliability.

### Operational Benefits

Automating inspections through computer vision reduces costs and speeds detection of issues that could cause outages or safety incidents. Drones can survey large areas quickly and safely, reducing the need for crews to climb poles or drive remote circuits. Early detection of vegetation encroachment allows proactive trimming, lowering fire risk and improving reliability during storms.

For renewable energy operators, computer vision can scan solar panel arrays for cracks, hotspots, or soiling, improving performance and reducing energy losses. On transmission lines, models can detect conductor sag or tower corrosion, supporting targeted maintenance before failures occur.

By scaling inspections with machine learning, utilities shift from infrequent, labor-heavy inspections to near-continuous monitoring that improves both reliability and safety.

### Transition to the Demo

In this chapter’s demo, we will build a computer vision pipeline for defect detection using drone imagery. We will:

* Train an object detection model to identify powerline components and vegetation.
* Run inference on sample images to detect anomalies.
* Store and visualize results, simulating how utilities could integrate findings into their maintenance workflows.

This demonstration shows how utilities can use computer vision to move beyond manual inspections and toward automated, data-driven asset monitoring that is faster, safer, and more cost-effective.
