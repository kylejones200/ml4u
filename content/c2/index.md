### The Business Problem: Data Without Insight

Utilities are data-rich but insight-poor. Every second, power grids generate vast amounts of telemetry from sensors, meters, and control systems. Smart meters report household consumption in 15-minute intervals. SCADA systems collect voltages and currents across substations and feeders. Phasor Measurement Units stream high-resolution synchrophasor data. Enterprise Asset Management platforms house detailed records of transformers, breakers, and other field equipment. Yet despite these torrents of data, many utilities still rely on manual processes, siloed systems, and static reports.

The root issue is fragmentation. Operational Technology (OT) systems like SCADA are often isolated from Information Technology (IT) environments that host enterprise and market data. AMI data may reside in separate customer information systems. Maintenance records might be buried in work order logs. Integrating these disparate streams is cumbersome, often requiring bespoke ETL pipelines. As a result, much of the data sits unused, limiting its value for analytics, machine learning, and decision support.

This creates tangible business problems. Maintenance crews lack predictive insights because equipment health data remains disconnected from condition monitoring sensors. Grid operators cannot fully leverage weather and demand data together to anticipate loading risks. Regulatory compliance reporting is tedious because data for audits is scattered across incompatible formats. The cost of inefficiency is high: missed opportunities to optimize investments, reduce outages, and improve customer satisfaction.

### The Analytics Solution: Preparing Data for Machine Learning

Analytics begins with data readiness. To make machine learning work for utilities, data must be accessible, reliable, and modeled in ways that reflect grid realities. This chapter focuses on the mechanics of preparing utility data for analysis. We will address three fundamental tasks.

First, data cleaning. Utility data is often noisy, containing gaps, duplicates, or faulty readings. Sensors malfunction, meters fail, and logs contain inconsistent timestamps. Cleaning requires handling missing values, removing erroneous spikes, and reconciling mismatched units or formats.

Second, resampling and alignment. Utility datasets operate at different granularities: AMI data may be every 15 minutes, SCADA readings every 4 seconds, and weather data hourly. Aligning these time series to common intervals allows joint analysis. This often involves aggregation (summing sub-minute SCADA readings to hourly values) or interpolation (filling short gaps in time series).

Third, feature integration. Meaningful analytics often emerges when multiple datasets are combined. Weather impacts demand, asset age influences failure rates, vegetation encroachment correlates with storm outages. Joining these datasets requires careful handling of time zones, coordinate systems for geospatial joins, and equipment identifiers across systems.

By addressing these steps systematically, utilities can unlock the full value of their data. Properly prepared datasets feed into machine learning models that predict failures, forecast load, and support data-driven investment planning.

### From Raw Records to Actionable Signals

A typical example is transformer monitoring. SCADA data may include transformer load and oil temperature, while EAM holds the installation date and maintenance history. By joining these, we can calculate load-to-age stress factors, compare them across similar units, and flag transformers at higher risk of failure. Without integrated data, such insights remain invisible.

Another example is storm readiness. Outage records stored in OMS systems can be combined with feeder vegetation data and historical weather records. By cleaning and aligning these datasets, we can train models that predict which circuits are most likely to fail during high winds. This directly informs crew staging and vegetation management priorities.

These cases highlight a recurring theme: data silos hide patterns that cross organizational boundaries. Preparing data for analytics is as much about breaking down silos as it is about technical preprocessing.

### Transition to the Demo

In this chapterâ€™s demo, we will work with synthetic smart meter and SCADA datasets to illustrate practical data preparation steps. You will:

* Load raw time series datasets and inspect their structure.
* Clean noisy data by detecting and correcting errors such as missing readings or sensor spikes.
* Resample data to common intervals suitable for modeling.
* Join multiple datasets into a unified view aligned by timestamp and identifier.

We will also visualize these transformations, showing how raw meter readings and SCADA telemetry evolve into clean, analytics-ready time series. This exercise mirrors the early stages of any utility data project: wrangling heterogeneous, messy data into a usable form.

This chapter lays the groundwork for everything that follows. Whether forecasting load, predicting outages, or optimizing maintenance schedules, the quality of insights depends on the quality of the underlying data. By mastering data preparation in the utility context, we establish the foundation on which machine learning models will be built in later chapters.
