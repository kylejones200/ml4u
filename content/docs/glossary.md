# Glossary

## A

**Anomaly Detection**  
A machine learning technique that identifies unusual patterns or outliers in data that deviate from normal behavior. In utilities, used to detect equipment malfunctions, cybersecurity threats, or operational irregularities.

**ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**  
A time series forecasting model that captures autoregressive patterns, trends (through differencing), and moving average components. Commonly used for load forecasting.

**Asset Management**  
The systematic process of managing physical infrastructure assets (transformers, breakers, lines) throughout their lifecycle, from installation to replacement.

## C

**Classification**  
A machine learning task that predicts discrete categories or labels (e.g., "healthy" vs. "failure-prone" for equipment).

**Clustering**  
An unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar observations together without predefined labels. Used for customer segmentation and asset grouping.

**Computer Vision**  
A field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from images or video. Used in utilities for automated infrastructure inspections.

## D

**Data Drift**  
Changes in the distribution of input data over time that can degrade model performance. Requires monitoring and periodic retraining.

**Data Lake**  
A centralized repository that stores raw data in its native format. Enables analytics on diverse data types without predefined schemas.

**Demand Response**  
Programs that encourage customers to reduce or shift electricity consumption during peak periods, helping utilities manage demand without building new generation capacity.

**DER (Distributed Energy Resources)**  
Small-scale power generation or storage systems located near where energy is consumed, such as rooftop solar panels, battery storage, or small wind turbines.

**Distribution Grid**  
The portion of the electric grid that delivers power from substations to end customers (homes, businesses).

## E

**EAM (Enterprise Asset Management)**  
Software systems that track and manage physical assets throughout their lifecycle, including maintenance records, inspections, and work orders.

**Ensemble Methods**  
Machine learning techniques that combine predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.

**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**  
The process of extracting data from source systems, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a target system for analysis.

## F

**Feature Engineering**  
The process of creating new input variables (features) from raw data to improve model performance. Examples include creating time-based features (hour of day, day of week) or interaction terms.

**Forecast Horizon**  
The time period into the future that a forecast predicts (e.g., 1 hour ahead, 24 hours ahead, 1 week ahead).

## G

**GIS (Geographic Information System)**  
Systems that capture, store, and analyze geographic and spatial data. Used in utilities to map infrastructure locations and analyze geospatial relationships.

**Grid**  
The interconnected network of power generation, transmission, and distribution systems that deliver electricity from producers to consumers.

## L

**Load Forecasting**  
The process of predicting future electricity demand. Critical for generation scheduling, market participation, and grid operations.

**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
A type of recurrent neural network designed to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. Used for load and renewable generation forecasting.

## M

**MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**  
A forecast accuracy metric that expresses error as a percentage of actual values. Commonly used in load forecasting.

**MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)**  
Practices and tools for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models in production environments.

**Model Drift**  
Degradation in model performance over time due to changes in data distribution or underlying relationships. Requires monitoring and retraining.

## N

**Net Load**  
The difference between total electricity demand and behind-the-meter generation (e.g., rooftop solar). What the grid must actually supply.

**NLP (Natural Language Processing)**  
A branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Used in utilities to analyze maintenance logs and compliance documents.

## O

**Orchestration**  
The automated coordination of multiple tasks or workflows, managing dependencies, scheduling, and error handling.

**Outage**  
An interruption in electric service to customers, caused by equipment failures, weather, or other factors.

**Overfitting**  
When a machine learning model learns patterns specific to training data that don't generalize to new data, resulting in poor performance on unseen examples.

## P

**Predictive Maintenance**  
A maintenance strategy that uses data and analytics to predict when equipment failures are likely to occur, enabling proactive intervention before failures happen.

**Precision**  
A classification metric measuring the proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct. Important when false alarms are costly.

**PMU (Phasor Measurement Unit)**  
High-speed sensors that measure voltage and current phasors across the grid, providing real-time visibility into grid conditions.

## R

**Recall**  
A classification metric measuring the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified. Important when missing failures is costly.

**Regression**  
A machine learning task that predicts continuous numerical values (e.g., load in megawatts, temperature in degrees).

**Reinforcement Learning**  
A machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

**Reliability Metrics**  
Measures of grid performance, such as SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index) and SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index).

## S

**SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)**  
Systems that monitor and control grid equipment in real time, collecting telemetry data and enabling remote control of switches, breakers, and other devices.

**SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**  
An extension of ARIMA that explicitly models seasonal patterns, essential for load forecasting which has strong daily and weekly cycles.

**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**  
A method for explaining individual model predictions by quantifying each feature's contribution to the prediction.

**Supervised Learning**  
Machine learning where models learn from labeled training data (inputs paired with known outputs).

## T

**Time Series**  
Data collected over time at regular intervals (e.g., hourly load, daily temperature). Requires specialized modeling techniques to capture temporal patterns.

**Transformer**  
Electrical equipment that changes voltage levels in the power grid. Also refers to a type of neural network architecture used in natural language processing.

**Transmission Grid**  
The high-voltage portion of the electric grid that moves power over long distances from generation plants to distribution substations.

## U

**Unsupervised Learning**  
Machine learning where models find patterns in data without labeled examples. Includes clustering and anomaly detection.

## V

**Voltage Control**  
The process of maintaining voltage levels within acceptable limits across the grid, typically through reactive power management.

## W

**Work Order**  
A formal request for maintenance, repair, or inspection of equipment, typically tracked in EAM systems.
